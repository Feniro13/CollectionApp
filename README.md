# CollectionApp
My collection app

An app I made in spring 2022 as a final project in Samsung IT School in Tomsk. 

The app should help people who wants to collect things, but don't want to write them down in complicated Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. CollectionApp offers
very easy and simple interface. You can easily create and redact your collection.

There are four activities here - start, create, edit and "view". Start is a simple one, it only includes two buttons. Create activity was a bit harder to make, here you can manage the number of columns in your collection and, of course, its name. The "Edit" activity shows you your collections you have already made. You can open or delete one. In future, you will also be able to rename your collection, but this function is still in work. 

Finally, "View" is a very complicated activity which includes all the work with your collection. Here you can add or remove item, and even google it. When you select a number of items, you can delete all of them, or unite them into one. You can also manage your "Wanted List" and add items to it to add them to the collections itself afterwards.
